arraycomm_midbit: Assert (xy)_k != (yx)_k where k is the middle output bit.

arraycomm: standard array commutativity instance asserting that Weight(xy) - Weight(yx) >= 1 or <= -1.

alg_arraycomm: commutativity instance with multiplier given as spec equation instead of circuit.

arraycomm_teq: commutativity with added t-equalities txy_i,j = tyx_j,i.

arraycomm_teq_tvars: commutativity with added t-equalities txy_i,j = tyx_j,i, and removed input variables x_i, y_i.
